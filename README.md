# 🚀 YOLOv8 Video Segmentation

This project demonstrates **real-time object detection and segmentation on video** using YOLOv8.

The pipeline reads a video file, performs detection frame-by-frame, saves annotated frames, and finally reconstructs the processed frames into an output video.

## 📌 Features

✅ Uses YOLOv8 Nano model  
✅ Processes video input  
✅ Saves detected frames  
✅ Converts frames back to video  
✅ Beginner friendly code structure  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Ultralytics YOLOv8  

---
## 📤 Output

After running the script, the following outputs will be generated:

✅ Detected frames will be saved as image files in the project folder.

✅ Final processed video will be created as:

## 🧠 Workflow

The project follows this simple pipeline:

1. Load YOLOv8 model  
2. Read input video frames  
3. Apply object detection on each frame  
4. Save annotated frames as images  
5. Merge processed frames back into output video
